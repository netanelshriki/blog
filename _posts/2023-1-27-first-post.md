# squeryBuilder: A Powerful SQL Query Builder Library

squeryBuilder is an open-source Java library that provides a fluent API for dynamically constructing SQL queries. With its intuitive syntax and type-safe approach, squeryBuilder simplifies the process of building complex SQL queries and helps prevent common errors.

## Features and Benefits

- **Fluent API**: squeryBuilder offers a fluent API for query construction, allowing you to chain method calls and create SQL queries in a readable and concise manner.
- **Dynamic Query Generation**: Generate SQL queries dynamically based on changing requirements or user inputs.
- **Type-Safe Query Building**: Utilize the Java type system to ensure type safety during query construction, preventing mismatched data types and SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Database-Agnostic**: squeryBuilder is compatible with various databases, abstracting away the specific SQL syntax and providing a consistent API.
- **Support for Complex Queries**: Build simple SELECT queries or complex JOIN statements with ease, thanks to a comprehensive set of query building methods.

## Getting Started

To start using squeryBuilder in your Java project, follow these steps:

1. Download squeryBuilder from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/squeryl/squeryl).
2. Include the squeryBuilder library in your project's dependencies.
3. Import the necessary classes from the squeryBuilder library into your Java code.
4. Create an instance of the `QueryBuilder` class to begin constructing your SQL query.
5. Use the provided methods to add clauses, filters, joins, and other components to the query.
6. Execute the generated query using your preferred database access mechanism (JDBC, JPA, etc.) and process the results.
